// Updating itself
//
// FastRoute is portable: a folder with the exe in it and the settings beside
// it, which is also what makes updating simple. The continuous build replaces
// one release, tagged "latest", on every push, and this looks at that release
// and unpacks it over the folder it is running from. Nothing is installed and
// nothing in the registry is touched.
//
// Settings are left alone by that, because they are not in the zip: the only
// things it contains are the exe and the documentation, so sessions.json and
// the rest survive being copied over.
//
// Every call that talks to the network blocks, and none of them may be made
// from the UI thread. ShowCheckForUpdates is the exception - it is the UI
// thread's entry point and starts its own.
